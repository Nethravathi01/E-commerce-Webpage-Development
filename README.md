E-commerce Webpage Development

This project is a static e-commerce webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that showcases products and provides a seamless shopping experience.

Project Features

* Product Listing – Display multiple products with images and descriptions.
* Add to Cart Functionality – Users can add products to a cart (to be enhanced in the backend).
* Dark Mode Toggle – Improves user experience with light/dark theme switching.
* Product Filtering – Users can filter products based on categories (upcoming enhancement).

Upcoming Enhancements (Backend Development)

I plan to integrate a backend system to make the webpage dynamic. The backend will be built using:
* Node.js & Express.js – For handling server-side logic.
* MongoDB/MySQL – For database management.
* User Authentication – Secure login & signup system.
* Order Processing – Manage purchases and transactions.

Stay tuned for backend updates!!
