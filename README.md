E-commerce Webpage Development

This project is a static e-commerce webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that showcases products and provides a seamless shopping experience.

Project Features

* Product Listing â€“ Display multiple products with images and descriptions.
* Add to Cart Functionality â€“ Users can add products to a cart (to be enhanced in the backend).
* Dark Mode Toggle â€“ Improves user experience with light/dark theme switching.
* Product Filtering â€“ Users can filter products based on categories (upcoming enhancement).

Upcoming Enhancements (Backend Development)

I plan to integrate a backend system to make the webpage dynamic. The backend will be built using:
ðŸ”¹ Node.js & Express.js â€“ For handling server-side logic.
ðŸ”¹ MongoDB/MySQL â€“ For database management.
ðŸ”¹ User Authentication â€“ Secure login & signup system.
ðŸ”¹ Order Processing â€“ Manage purchases and transactions.

Stay tuned for backend updates!!
